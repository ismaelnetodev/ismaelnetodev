# 👋 Hello! I'm Ismael Neto!

I'm a backend-focused developer, but I'm open to Full Stack opportunities and, in the future, I'd love to become a game developer 🎮. Right now, I'm most comfortable with Python, and I'm learning JavaScript and Java along the way!

## 🚀 What I'm working on?
- Developing new projects to build up my portfolio.
- Focused on learning Java and diving into game development (Unity and Unreal Engine are on my list!).
- Exploring new tech like C#, C++, CI/CD, and Docker 🐳.

## 💻 Recent Projects
- A Flask-based API project (still a work in progress, but a great learning experience!).
- Experiments with various APIs, including GPT, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text conversion.

## 🔧 Technologies I'm working with
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Java (learning), and exploring C# and C++.
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Flask, various APIs, Docker (soon).
- **Future Goals:** Game development with Unity and Unreal Engine.

## 🎮 A little more about me
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing video games 🎮, listening to music 🎧, or brainstorming new programming ideas 👨‍💻. I'm always open to collaborating on new projects, so feel free to reach out!
